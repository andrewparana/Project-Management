## Final project Bridge play
Andrew Parana, Fall 2025.


### Abstract    
As gamers myself I tend to grow frustrated with these game developers releasing unfinished games and not listening to gamer feedback and also making game design decisions without having the players in their mind. This research project will identify a way for developers to better relate to their players through the implementation of design techniques based on collected game-play-related data. A combination of scheduled data collection dates, ongoing instantaneous feedback from the players, and improvement will provide a framework for reducing the existing divide between gamers and developers. An environment to develop collaborative relationships; develop a long-standing trust relationship with their player base; develop a supportive, prosperous gaming industry.

#### Introduction
My emphasis throughout the course on developing games that create a fully immersive experience, that use community feedback as part of the design process, and that create lasting relationships with gamers, as a developer myself has made me highly disappointed when I have seen developers release games without having incorporated these elements in their development process. This disconnect also creates a large amount of distrust towards the developer. This project presents a method for creating a fully developed "game environment" that incorporates community feedback and structured data collections, analysis, and continuous improvements to better support the gaming community.

#### Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to design and to develop a community-based game development using player feedback from the community to promote better interaction and understanding between players and game developers. Many games fail because the game developers do not consider the differences between their expectations and those of the potential audience when creating their games. Through the creation of a regular system to gather, evaluate, and incorporate regular feedback from players into the game creation process, this project will eliminate the gap between what players want from their games, and what the creators of games believe is important for the players to experience.

By creating a roadmap for developers and giving them access to player expectations, this project will provide the means for players to participate in the development process of the games they love. The purpose of this project is not simply to create better games, it is also aims to build a healthy, open, and transparent culture of game development, where Player feedback is highly valued, where communication is the most important part of it, and decisions regarding game design are made based on actual data rather than assumptions.

#### The Audience 

The target audience of the project is gamers and game developers that would benefit directly from a community focused and data driven development model:


1. Gamers (Every Type of Player)


Gamers are the primary user base for the system created through this project. The goal of this project is to give power back to the gamer by allowing them to express their own experiences, frustrations and desires as a result of their involvement in gaming. This project will allow gamers that dedicate a large amount of time and energy to the game an opportunity to have their feedback taken into consideration when making future development decisions. There are many types of gamers (i.e. the casual gamer, hardcore gamer, and those who have a long-standing affinity for a particular genre of games).


2. Game Developers and Studios


Smaller teams, independent developers, and mid-sized development studios may benefit from using the development model established by this project because it reduces the risk associated with developing video games, while simultaneously increasing the satisfaction level of the gamers. Developers using this system will have a clearer understanding of what their target audience prefers, therefore allowing them to avoid costly mistakes such as developing features that their audience does not want, or ignoring large amounts of negative feedback. In addition, the developers will have the ability to maintain long-lasting relationships with their communities based on mutual trust and support.


3. Playtesters and Community Contributors


Individuals who enjoy testing video games, reporting bugs, and/or participating in early access type of programs also form a secondary audience that should be considered as part of this project. They will now have a structured way of providing feedback, and will be able to keep track of how their feedback is being used to shape the development of those games which interest them.

#### Understanding Technical Debt 

There is always some technical debt at the beginning of the game development process even when the project has been well planned. Each developer will typically incur some form of technical debt, even if they have made prudent and careful choices, in order to complete projects more quickly, work within tool limitations, or proceed with projects without all the available information necessary to complete them as originally intended.
One example of how they incur technical debt is by utilizing a game engine they are familiar with that meets approximately 80% of their initial requirements, with the understanding the remaining 20% of functionality will be developed with workarounds. Furthermore, an organization can accrue technical debt over time (e.g., within five years), due to technology (tools) becoming outdated, deprecation of core features within the game engine due to evolution of the industry, and increase in licensing fees and associated costs.
How Organizations Can Minimize Technical Debt Unable to effectively support and track their projects, organizations risk incurring substantial additional costs due to the time wasted developing, modifying, or reconstructing older systems. As well, organizations will have difficulty keeping pace with technological advancements that continue to evolve at a rapid rate, hence leading to an excess of technical debt. In order to minimize technical debt and to reduce risk over the long run, development teams should.
Importance of Minimizing Technical Debt Organizations Must:
1. Select tools based on the future scalability and maintainability of tools used by development team members.
2. Ensure that user satisfaction and developer productivity are both balanced when making decisions about tools used by development teams.
3. Do not choose tools that appear to be inexpensive or quick fixes but will generate unnecessary long-term complications.
4. Select tools with strong community support and ongoing maintenance.
5. Design systems that are modular in nature so that obsolete components can easily be replaced without affecting the rest of the project.
6. Continuously monitor the tools being used and proactively update the tools as soon as feasible instead of waiting for a serious problem to occur.

By taking a proactive approach, technical debt becomes manageable rather than a threat to the project.

#### Open-Source Project Model


The objectives of this project include collaboration, transparency, and innovation. The goal of this project is to be fully open-source, allowing developers, players and community experts to contribute to the ongoing progress of the project, ensuring it will become a continually evolving project and have shared ownership among contributors.


Open-source principles are at the core of this project; below are four examples of how these principles are being applied to the project:


1) Transparency


The documentation of all major design decisions, all methods of providing feedback and all development updates, will be available to anyone on the internet. The contributions of both players and contributors will be displayed so they may see the impact of their feedback on the overall development of the project and give them greater assurance and faith in the project.


2) Collaboration Between Disciplines


Open-source allows the contributions of various fields, such as developers, UI Design, Data Analysis, Community Managers, and Players to provide additional insights. All insights are then provided as a group for consideration in the final product to create an all-inclusive outcome based on a multitude of views.


3) Continuous Improvement


By having publicly available contributions to the project, the project will be able to continue to iterate and adjust. The speed at which bugs can be fixed, new features can be added and the overall development workflow is enhanced by being able to use the latest tools and technologies.


4) Shared Ownership and Community Involvement


Unlike other projects that require all participants to be from one company, this project encourages community involvement. Contributors receive credit for their contributions, build their resumes and are part of building an overall development model that will benefit the entire gaming community.

#### Workflow: Data-informed Game Development Process

Data Collection → Analysis → Development → Testing → Feedback Loop → Improvement

Each arrow will need to represent or include feedback from players/audience of the game:
Need to see the data from other games of genre what players like and don’t like and try to implement them into the game
Playtest feedback is very important in this process especially if we wanted to succeed
Continuous monitoring ensures scalability and maintainability.

### Conclusion   

This initiative introduces an all-inclusive, research-driven framework that addresses the long-standing communication barrier between game creators and the audience they serve. The initiative allows for better-quality games to be created by helping to generate ideas around how to improve game quality based on actual user input rather than assumptions. The initiative also establishes trust, accountability and long-term involvement of the gaming community's members.

By defining the end-user audience of the initiative, the goals of the initiative become even stronger. Gamers, Developers, Playtesters and Researchers all benefit from a model that facilitates interactions that are meaningful and encompass user input. Users have an opportunity to provide input into the development of games they enjoy, while Developers have defined areas of focus for their time and resources based on actual player input. Acknowledging the interconnectedness of these three groups demonstrates that successful game development occurs when there is balance in participation by everyone involved.

By becoming an open-source project, the opportunity for additional benefits will grow exponentially. Through an open-source project framework, this project has the potential to create an ultimately greater impact. The open-source model provides for transparency, community ownership, collaborative efforts, and ongoing development in the community. Through collaboration with the community and an approach to collective design that is available for public review, the project will create a reduction in technical debt, a speed-up of developing new innovations, and a utilize more sustainable development practices.  

Thus, overall, the project provides game creators with a range of methods, tools, and strategies for creating chemical and sustainable methods of producing video games, as well as an up-to-date useful framework for providing games that reflect the interests of end-users. The combined use of data collected from users, engaged input from a diverse group of communities, and open-source methods will lead to the development of a new direction for how game production takes place.
